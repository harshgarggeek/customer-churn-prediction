# Customer Churn Prediction Model

## Overview
This project predicts customer churn for a telecom company using machine learning techniques.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Models Implemented
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest

## Steps Performed
- Loaded and explored telecom customer data
- Handled missing values and data cleaning
- Encoded categorical variables and scaled numerical features
- Addressed class imbalance using SMOTE
- Trained and compared models
- Evaluated using accuracy, ROC-AUC, precision-recall curve, and confusion matrix
- Selected best model and saved it as `.pkl`

## Results
Random Forest achieved better performance in terms of ROC-AUC and recall for churned customers.
